# DocumentDownloader

Package: `io.github.phillmon.selenium.modulars.reader`

Works out the url of a document based on a [DocumentSource](DocumentSource.md)
and downloads it to a local file, reusing the browser's own cookies so
documents behind a login still download correctly. Every document reader
(Excel, PDF, text, Word) shares one of these.

## Related classes

- [DocumentSource](DocumentSource.md) — describes what to resolve into a file.
- [UniqueFileNames](UniqueFileNames.md) — generates the file name used for a fresh download.
- [ReaderException](ReaderException.md) — thrown for any download/delete/directory failure.
- [AbstractDocumentReaderActions](AbstractDocumentReaderActions.md) — every reader holds one of these as `downloader`.
- [ReaderActionsContainer](../../base/ReaderActionsContainer.md) — creates one shared instance for all four readers.
- [PageModularOptions](../../base/PageModularOptions.md) — `withDownloadDirectory` / `withDownloadTimeout` configure the instance built for a page object.

## Usage example

Usually you don't construct this yourself — [ReaderActionsContainer](../../base/ReaderActionsContainer.md)
does it for you via [PageModularOptions](../../base/PageModularOptions.md).
Direct use looks like:

```java
DocumentDownloader downloader = new DocumentDownloader(driver, Path.of("build/downloads"), Duration.ofSeconds(45));
Path file = downloader.resolve(DocumentSource.fromUrl("https://example.com/report.pdf"), "pdf", "downloadReport");
downloader.delete(file, "cleanupReport");
```

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
|---|---|
| `DocumentDownloader(WebDriver)` | Default directory (system temp folder), 30-second timeout. |
| `DocumentDownloader(WebDriver, Path defaultDirectory)` | Custom default directory, 30-second timeout. |
| `DocumentDownloader(WebDriver, Path defaultDirectory, Duration requestTimeout)` | Full control. Creates the directory immediately. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `resolve(DocumentSource, fileExtension, methodName)` | Resolves into the default directory. |
| `resolve(DocumentSource, fileExtension, targetDirectory, methodName)` | Resolves into a custom directory. |
| `delete(Path filePath, methodName)` | Deletes a downloaded file if it still exists. |

All methods throw [ReaderException](ReaderException.md) on download,
directory-creation, or delete failures.
